        <p>In 2019, Cameroon had over 900,000 internally displaced people, 51% of whom were children with many ending up on the streets of cities like Yaounde and Douala and to a lesser extent Kumba and Tiko in the south-west province. In the past 10 years, the number of street children in Cameroon has increased from around 1,000 to over 20,000 and this surge has, at least in part, been attributed to the separatist crisis in the country's English speaking north-west and south-west regions in addition to Boko Haram's terrorist attacks in the region along Cameroon's northern border with Nigeria causing many to flee their homes. These children  end up doing whatever it takes to survive, putting thmeselves at risk of exploitation and trafficking often ending up working on agricultural plantations without compensation as well as in factories, street selling and fishing, and in all whith little or no hope of schooling again. So with your help we help these children to once again dream to have a better life in some time ahead.</p>

        <p>Unemployment in Cameroon is already high even for those with an education but for children who live, beg and steal on the streets there is little prospect of employment without exploitation. As one teenage street child stated, "A friend advised me to come to Cameroon, telling me there is work and money to be had here, but since I arrived [two months ago], I have seen nothing of that." In fact, most end up foraging for food in rubbish bins and, when they become ill, they can't afford to see a doctor. 44.9% of these teenagers had been homeless for a period of 7â€“12 months, whereas 35.8% had been homeless for less than 6 months and 19.3% for more than 13 months. In a relatively harsh regime, some get arrested for smoking or begging and find themselves incarcerated in adult prisons often for months, sometimes years at a time before their case is brought to court. In the meantime they are at further risk of catching AIDS related illnesses from older, infected prisoners awaiting trial.</p>

        <p>Some of these street children in Cameroon are trafficked into the country from neighbouring Nigeria and Gabon and are forced to work as domestic servants, however some flee this life and, without resources to return home, join the hundreds of others living rough in bus stops and video game houses. Others find refuge on the verandas of off-licences and bars, whilst others find sanctuary in abandoned or uncompleted houses. Of course, even when help is available, some of these street children refuse to be reunited with their families given they fled in the first place to avoid abuse. </p>
